Ajax uses XHTML for content CSS for presentation
along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display. Conventional web applications transmit information to and from the sever using synchronous requests. It means you fill out a form,
hit submit and get directed to a new page with new information from the server. With AJAX,
when you hit submit avaScript will make a request to the server,
interpret the results and update the current screen. In the purest sense,
the user would never know that anything was even transmitted to the server. XML is commonly used as the format for receiving server data,
although any format including plain text can be used.
